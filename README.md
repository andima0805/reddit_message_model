# reddit_message_model
#This machine learning project is a data cleaning model via Reddit API using Python. It classifies real-time messages from the subreddit channel “politics”. The goal is to identify whether the message’s stance is more politically right or left. The primary process of data preparation involves removing stopwords, stemming and vectorization to get the main body information of the text. Then I started to test the model on a different set of data to avoid data leakage. The final result will indicate the percentage likelihood of the message’s political stance.
